              <p>
              Best <b><i><a href="https://www.doctorsqueries.com/doctors">dermatologists </a></i></b>in Delhi know that a skin condition doesn’t have to be life-threatening to reduce a person’s quality of life. Hair transplant treatment is a procedure for treating hair loss. Hair transplants involve taking hair-bearing skin from one part of the scalp and grafting these pieces of skin onto bald or thinning areas of the scalp or areas of trauma.
              <br /><br />
              <b><i>Hair transplant treatment in Delhi </i></b>is fruitful and cost-effective. Delhi has become the new central hub for the best dermatologist in Delhi and hair transplant treatment in Delhi.
          
        
              </p>

                <h3 class="sm:text-3xl font-medium text-gray-900" >How Common Is Hair Loss?</h3>
                <p>Everyone loses hair daily at a rate of approximately 50 to 150 individual hairs per day. Usually, the hair will grow back. If the hair follicle is thinned, however, this re-growth does not occur. All men experience some degree of gradual hair loss in their lifetime as a result of natural aging and changes in the male hormone androgen. Women also face hair loss.</p>

                <br /><br />

                <h3 class="sm:text-3xl font-medium text-gray-900" >What is the Procedure for Hair Transplant Treatment in Delhi?</h3>
                <p>Hair transplant treatment in Delhi is painless. A thin strip of skin with hair is removed from the back of your head and divided into pieces, each containing 1 to 4 hairs (hair grafts). The grafts are placed into tiny cuts made in the scalp. The site where the hairs are taken is closed with stitches.</p>
<br /><br />
                <h4 class="sm:text-4xl font-medium text-gray-900" >Does the procedure hurt?</h4>
                <p>With the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, discomfort during the procedure is eliminated.</p>
<br /><br />

                <h4 class="sm:text-4xl font-medium text-gray-900" >Am I a good candidate for the Hair transplant procedure?</h4>
                <p>The ideal candidate for hair restoration surgery had healthy hair on the sides and back of the head.  These sites are used as donor areas for the grafts. Men and women with well-defined baldness, thinning hair, and those with limited hair loss due to scalp injuries or repeated cosmetic procedures are generally good candidates for <b><i>hair transplant treatment in Delhi.</i></b></p>
<br /><br />

<h4 class="sm:text-4xl font-medium text-gray-900" >Will I be able to swim and enjoy other physical activities with my new hair?</h4>
                <p>You will be able to participate in any of the activities you enjoy within five to seven days after treatment. Your transplanted hair is permanent and may be washed, cut, and dyed</p>
<br /><br />


<h4 class="sm:text-4xl font-medium text-gray-900" >Will my transplanted hair eventually fall out?</h4>
                <p>When you have hair grafted from the back and sides of your scalp to your balding areas, called an autograft, the hair grows for the rest of your life.</p>
<br /><br />



<h3 class="sm:text-3xl font-medium text-gray-900" >Are there any complications from the treatment?</h3>
<p>
As with all treatment procedures, there is always some risk. However, complications from the <b><i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/doctorsqueries/">treatment</a></i></b> of hair loss are rare and generally minimal. Bleeding or infections are infrequent and minor. In general, one should avoid certain medicines or herbal remedies before the treatment. If one has specific concerns, please discuss them with the physician first.
</p>
